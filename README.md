# Analog-Clock
This project is a responsive analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically displays the current time with a smooth, real-time animation of the hour, minute, and second hands. It's a great demonstration of using JavaScript's Date API for real-time updates and leveraging CSS animations and transformations for smooth, seamless motion.
